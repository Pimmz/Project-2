# Famous Quote Matcher Testing


Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.


To ensure that Famous Quote Matcher works effectively over a number of sites and devices, I have prepared details and screenshots for you to see the testing I have done to ensure it is very reliable..




## Code Validation




### HTML


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.




Below is a link for you to see live that my code is valid plus I have enclosed a screenshot in the case for some reason that fails;




| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FPimmz.github.io%2FProject-2%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/w3validator-html.png) | Pass: No Errors |




### CSS


I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.


Below is a link for you to see live that my code is valid plus I have enclosed a screenshot in case, for some reason that fails;




| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FPimmz.github.io%2FProject-2) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/w3validator-css.png) | Pass: No Errors |




### JavaScript


I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.


Below is a screenshot of JShint validator to confirm no errors


| File | Screenshot | Notes |

| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/jshint.png) | No Errors |






## Browser Compatibility


I have tested Famous Quote Matcher on four different browsers. The first was Chrome, the second was Firefox, the third was Brave and the fourth was Opera. I would have liked to test on Safari but unfortunately, I donâ€™t have access to an Apple device.


- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)




I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. To ensure that all are working correctly I have also tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile

## Bugs


While testing I found a couple of error commands that I have explained below with screenshots so you can see them for yourself;


- JS Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression


   ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/error.png)


   - To fix this, I ensured it wasnt empty using the following code;


   ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/error-fix.png)


- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'arrow` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6.


   ![screenshot](documentation/testing/testing-images/error1.png)


   - To fix this, I included jshint esversion: 11 and it took the errors away.
