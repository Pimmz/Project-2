# Famous Quote Matcher


Welcome to the Famous Quote Matcher. The memory game was created to help fill those times when you need a bit of relaxation. I created the memory game because it was one of my favourite games when I was growing up. I found that it challenged me mentally and helped me improve my memory while having fun.
Famous Quote Matcher has been designed so anyone can enjoy this simple but enjoyable game. I have used quotes instead of traditional picture cards so that the user can learn something while they play. I decided that the quotes used would be from Iconic people that have changed so many lives. I wanted the quotes to be informative and funny so the user would hopefully find them funny and informative.

Here's a screenshot of the website for you to see from amiresponsive

## Design Process (UX)

When I started the design of Famous Quote Matcher I wanted to ensure the site was Useful, Useable and Valuable so that it makes the user experience informative and enjoyable. To do this I looked at the five key fundamentals;
                        
Strategy - So the user can enjoy this simple, enjoyable, memory game while learning a little bit about some of our greatest icons.

Scope - Based on the information from the strategy, the features included emotive images, which offered key information about the quote the famous person said. A timer so the user can see what their best was, so they can try to beat it. I also included a section so they can see how many guesses they made so they can not only complete the game as fast as possible but also do it in the least amount of moves. A how-to-play feature was also included so the user can see how to play the game if they are not familiar with this particular game. The option to reset the game was also included so they can put the game back to the start at any point. Update: I have decided to include a leaderboard in the design so that it creates more of a challenge for the user.

Structure - This was designed around the user. After speaking with a number of the general public, they wanted to know how to play the game. the time they took to complete it, the amount of guesses they had taken and to have the ability to reset the game at any time.

Skeleton - As before this was designed around the user which was gained from information supplied by the general public. This dictated that it would be one page, laid out simply. So that it can be used quickly and efficiently while delivering the most amount of fun and gaining a small amount of knowledge as well.

Surface - I wanted the look of Famous Quote Matcher to be informative, clear, and concise, with consistent typography and corresponding colours to help them stand out, to easily navigate with emotive pictures that helped to bring an element of fun which I believe we all need on a daily basis.

Then I sat down and roughly sketched out onto paper what the screens would look like on a mobile, tablet and desktop, This then gave me the basis to start creating Famous Quote Matcher in Codeanywhere.

### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme I used the colours below;

- `white` was used for the primary text.
- `rgb(247, 224, 224);` was used for primary highlights.
- `box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);` was used for the box shadow.
- `black` was used for secondary highlights.


To help with the colour choice I used mycolorspace https://mycolor.space/ it allowed me to generate the colours that best matched the game background.

### Typography

I looked for fonts on Google Fonts, to help me decide as it gave a better visual aid for me to see how they all looked in their different weights. After many hours trying the fonts out on my game, I decided to use Bubblegum Sans all the way through to ensure a good balance, with a consistent look and feel. As a backup, I used sans-serif as it has a great look and then my third choice was serif as a fallback in case the other two weren't available.


- [bubblegum sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans?query=bubble) was used for all the text and headers.




## Icons

To help with making Famous Quote Matcher as user-friendly as possible I used icons from font awesome. This helped highlight specific areas to bring the user's attention to it.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the title.

## Wireframes

To follow best practices, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.

I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes. I've updated the design from my earlier sketch to incorporate a leaderboard so it can create more of a challenge for the user.

## Features

Famous Quote Matcher has been designed so anyone can enjoy this simple but challenging game. I have used quotes instead of traditional picture cards so the user can learn something while they play.
The features were designed around the user. After speaking with a number of the general public, they wanted to know how to play the game. the time they have taken to complete it, the number of guesses they had taken and to have the ability to reset the game at any time.


- **Title Feature #1**

  - Fun, catchy and informative title. As fun is the main aim of the game, bubblegum sans font was chosen so that it wasn't a very formal title, giving it a warm feeling, and helping to draw the user into playing it. The name was chosen to be catchy and informative so the user can easily understand what the game is about so they can look forward to playing it.

- **Timer & Guesses made Feature #2**

  - Guesses made and Timer feature. In order for the game to have a real edge over the competition and following the feedback from the public, the guesses-made feature was added so that the user can constantly challenge themselves to get a lower amount of guesses. The timer feature was also added for the same reasons plus it adds a sense of pressure to the game so that the user completes the game in as little time as possible.

![screenshot](documentation/testing/timer-feature.png)


- **Quote card feature #3**

  - Famous Quote Matcher has been designed so anyone can enjoy this simple and challenging game. The memory game is a great way to enjoy and challenge yourself.
  I have used quotes instead of the traditional picture cards so that the user can learn something while they play and to add a bit more of a fun element I selected quotes that hopefully make the user laugh. Plus learn a bit of information about a famous icon. Which will in turn make the whole experience that much more entertaining.

![screenshot](documentation/testing/quote-card-feature.jpg)


- **How to play feature #4**

  - The how-to-play feature was added after feedback from the general public. Although this is a quite straightforward game to play, it was felt that it would clear up any uncertainty if it was explained how to play the game. making the experience that much more clearer and enjoyable to the user.

![screenshot](documentation/testing/htp-feature.png)


- **Reset feature #5**

  - The reset button was added following feedback from the general public and as part of a main requirement for the game. In order for it to be reset once the user had completed the game. This way once all the cards had been turned over, you can simply press the reset button and the game turns all the cards over and sets the guesses made and timer to zero. Making it ready to play.

![screenshot](documentation/testing/reset-feature.png)


- **Leaderboard feature #6**

  - The leaderboard was added after the initial design because I believe it creates more of a challenge for the user. I also sought feedback from the general public about my idea and they agreed it was a welcome addition. The leaderboard tracks the top five best times achieved, so the user can see their best time and then constantly try to improve. Making the game a lot more immersive for the user.

### Future Features

- Adding a lot more cards.
  - I would love to add a lot more cards to the existing eight. because currently, it is quite easy to complete, whereas if there were a lot more, potentially up to 32 cards it would give the user a real challenge to match the quotes to the famous person.

- User sign-in option.
  - Having the option to allow the user to sign in on an individual log-in would be a great addition to the game so that the user would have a more personal and private game-playing experience.

-  email the score to the user.
    - It would be a great addition to the game to be able to email the end score to the user so they knew what score they achieved.

- Shuffle feature
  - So the game would get more challenging. I would like to add a shuffle feature so that you didn't always know exactly where the cards would be situated. I would have added this if I hadnt spent so long on the leaderboard, which then pushed me for time to keep level with the progress checklist.
